# diceGame

This is a simple excercise I followed during the Makers PreCourse. 

The instructions were to: 

If I roll higher than my opponent, I win.
Let's agree now that the program returning false means 'I lose', and true means 'I win'.

Write the dice game as above.
Upgrade the dice game: now both I and my opponent roll two six-sided dice each.
Upgrade the game once more: now we play several rounds for each game. The first player to win two rounds wins the game. (Still with two dice each.)

I extended that in the file F.
